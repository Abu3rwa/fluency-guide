# Fill-in-Blanks Task Page Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the React-based fill-in-blanks task page, addressing current issues and enhancing the user experience based on Flutter reference implementation.

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Strengths

- **Drag & Drop Functionality**: Implements react-dnd for interactive blank filling
