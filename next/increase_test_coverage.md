## Increase Test Coverage

To improve the robustness of the application, it is important to increase test coverage.

**Plan:**
1.  Set up a testing framework like Jest and React Testing Library if not already done.
2.  Write unit tests for all critical components, especially those with complex logic.
3.  Write integration tests for user flows, such as authentication, course creation, and enrollment.
4.  Aim for a test coverage of at least 80%.
