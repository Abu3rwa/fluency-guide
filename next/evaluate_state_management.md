## Evaluate State Management

As the application grows, a more robust state management solution may be needed.

**Plan:**
1.  Evaluate the current state management solution (React Context).
2.  Consider more advanced libraries like Redux or Zustand if the application state becomes too complex.
3.  If a new library is chosen, refactor the state management to use it.
4.  Ensure that the state management is well-documented.
