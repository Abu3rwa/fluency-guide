## Refactor CSS

To improve maintainability and consistency, the CSS should be refactored.

**Plan:**
1.  Choose a CSS-in-JS library (e.g., styled-components, Emotion) or a CSS methodology (e.g., BEM).
2.  Create a consistent theme and design system.
3.  Incrementally refactor the existing CSS files, starting with the most used components.
4.  Remove the old CSS files as they are replaced.
