# Possible Improvements for CourseDetailsScreen.jsx

## 1. Refactor into Smaller Components

- Break the file into smaller, focused components (e.g., CourseHeader, ModuleList, LessonList, TaskDialog, etc.).

## 2. Use State Management Library

- Consider using Redux, Zustand, or Context API for complex state instead of many useState hooks.

## 3. Improve Error Handling

- Standardize and centralize error handling for all async operations.

## 4. Enhance Accessibility

- Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and accessibility checks for dialogs and interactive elements.

## 5. Optimize Performance

- Review useEffect and useCallback dependencies to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Use React.memo or useMemo for expensive computations and pure components.

## 6. Extract Constants and Enums

- Move magic numbers/strings (like tab indices, sort keys) to a constants file.

## 7. Improve UI/UX

- Simplify dialogs and forms, provide better feedback, and ensure a clean, intuitive layout.

## 8. Add Comments and Documentation

- Add comments to explain complex logic and component structure.
- Provide a high-level overview at the top of the file.

## 9. Remove Unused Imports

- Regularly clean up unused or redundant imports.

## 10. Move Inline Styles to CSS/Theme

- Move inline styles to CSS modules or theme files for better maintainability.
