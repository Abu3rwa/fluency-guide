# Lesson Details Page Plan (React)

## 1. **Purpose & Scope**

- Build a modern, responsive Lesson Details page for students.
- The page should display all relevant lesson information, progress, resources, and actions.
- Design and behavior should be inspired by the Dart/Flutter code in `to react` and follow the project's design system (ThemeContext.js).
- Must support i18n, accessibility (a11y), and be mobile-first.

---

## 2. **UI/UX Structure**

### **A. Page Layout**

- Use a main container with max width and responsive padding/margins.
- Sticky or fixed header with lesson title and quick actions (e.g., back, mark complete).
- Main content split into sections (use MUI Grid/Stack for layout):
  - Lesson Overview (title, description, objectives)
  - Video/Audio/Media player (if available)
  - Lesson Content (rich text, images, etc.)
  - Resources/Materials (downloadable files, links)
  - Progress/Status (completion, attempts, etc.)
  - Actions (mark as complete, start quiz, etc.)
  - Instructor Info (avatar, name, bio, contact)
  - Support/FAQ (if relevant)

### **B. Responsiveness**

- Mobile-first: All sections stack vertically on small screens.
- Use MUI breakpoints for adaptive layouts (e.g., side-by-side on desktop).
- Ensure all buttons, touch targets, and text are accessible and readable on all devices.

### **C. Theming**

- Use `ThemeContext.js` for all colors, typography, spacing, and component overrides.
- Support both light and dark modes.
- Use theme's border radius, shadows, and spacing for all cards, dialogs, and containers.

### **D. Accessibility (a11y)**

- Use semantic HTML (e.g., `<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`).
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible.
- Use ARIA labels/roles where needed (e.g., for media players, progress bars).
- Ensure sufficient color contrast.

### **E. Internationalization (i18n)**

- All static text must use translation keys (see `/locales`).
- Support RTL layout for Arabic.
- Dynamic content (lesson title, description, etc.) should be translated if available.

---

## 3. **State & Data Management**

### **A. Data Sources**

- Fetch lesson details from backend (Firebase or REST API):
  - Title, description, objectives, content, media URLs, resources, instructor info, progress, etc.
- Use context or hooks for user/session data.
- Use loading and error states for all async data.

### **B. State**

- Local state for UI (e.g., expanded/collapsed sections, dialogs, snackbars).
- Progress/completion state (from backend and/or local for optimistic UI).
- Track which resources have been viewed/downloaded.

### **C. Actions**

- Mark lesson as complete/incomplete (update backend and UI state).
- Start quiz or assignment (navigate to task page).
- Download/view resources.
- Contact instructor/support (open dialog or mailto link).

---

## 4. **Componentization**

- Break page into reusable components:
  - `LessonHeaderSection` (title, actions)
  - `LessonMediaPlayer` (video/audio)
  - `LessonContentSection` (rich text)
  - `LessonObjectivesList`
  - `LessonResourcesPanel`
  - `LessonProgressBar`
  - `LessonActionsBar`
  - `InstructorInfoCard`
  - `SupportDialog` / `FAQSection`
- Each component should:
  - Use theme for styling
  - Accept props for data/state
  - Be fully responsive and accessible
  - Use translation keys for all static text

---

## 5. **Integration & Navigation**

- Integrate with app router (e.g., `/lessons/:lessonId`).
- Support deep linking and browser navigation.
- Provide back navigation to course/module/previous page.
- Handle missing/invalid lesson IDs gracefully (show error or redirect).

---

## 6. **Loading, Error, and Empty States**

- Show skeleton loaders while fetching data.
- Show user-friendly error messages (with retry option) on failure.
- Show empty state illustrations/messages if no content/resources.

---

## 7. **Testing & Quality**

- Unit and integration tests for all components (React Testing Library).
- Test all breakpoints and RTL layout.
- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility.
- Test with both English and Arabic locales.

---

## 8. **Future Enhancements**

- Allow students to leave feedback or rate the lesson.
- Show related lessons or next steps.
- Integrate with notifications/reminders for incomplete lessons.
- Support for lesson comments/discussion.

---

## 9. **Potential Issues & Considerations**

- Ensure all dynamic content is sanitized to prevent XSS.
- Handle slow or unreliable network gracefully.
- Consider caching lesson data for offline/low-connectivity use.
- Plan for extensibility (e.g., new resource types, new actions).

---

## 10. **References**

- Dart/Flutter code in `to react` for feature parity and inspiration.
- Theme and design tokens in `/contexts/ThemeContext.js`.
- Existing course/lesson page components for consistency.
- i18n keys and structure in `/locales`.

---

**Next Steps:**

- Review this plan with stakeholders.
- Create component and route skeletons.
- Implement data fetching and state management.
- Build and test each section/component iteratively.
