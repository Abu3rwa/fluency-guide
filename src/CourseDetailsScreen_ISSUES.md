# Issues in CourseDetailsScreen.jsx

## 1. Large File Size

- The file is very large (nearly 1000 lines), making it hard to maintain and understand.

## 2. Too Many Responsibilities

- Handles data fetching, state management, UI rendering, dialogs, and notifications all in one file (violates Single Responsibility Principle).

## 3. Repeated Code

- Dialog and notification handling code is repeated for different entities (courses, lessons, modules, tasks).

## 4. Tight Coupling

- Directly imports and uses many components and services, making it hard to test or refactor.

## 5. State Management

- Uses many useState hooks for related state, which could be grouped or managed with useReducer or a state management library.

## 6. Error Handling

- Error handling is present but not always consistent or user-friendly.

## 7. Performance

- Some useEffect and useCallback dependencies may cause unnecessary re-renders or data fetching.

## 8. UI/UX

- The UI is complex and may be overwhelming for users. Some dialogs and forms could be simplified or split into smaller components.

## 9. Accessibility

- No explicit accessibility checks (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation for dialogs).

## 10. Hardcoded Strings

- Some strings are hardcoded instead of using i18n translation keys.

## 11. Magic Numbers/Strings

- Some values (like tab indices, sort keys) are hardcoded and could be replaced with enums or constants.

## 12. Unused/Redundant Imports

- There may be unused or redundant imports due to the file's size and complexity.

## 13. Inline Styles

- Some inline styles could be moved to CSS or theme files for better maintainability.

## 14. Lack of Comments

- The file lacks comments explaining complex logic or component structure.
