## 1. Navigation & Discoverability

- **Module & Lesson Filtering**
  - Add a sidebar, dropdown, or tabs to filter lessons by selected module. Example: "Show only lessons from Module 2".
  - Allow multi-select or quick toggles to view lessons from multiple modules at once.
  - Add breadcrumbs or a navigation tree for quick context and movement between modules, lessons, and tasks.
- **Task Filtering**
  - When a lesson is selected, display only its tasks. Add a dropdown to switch between lessons quickly.
  - Enable search and advanced filters (status, type, difficulty, due date) for both lessons and tasks.
  - Provide a global search bar to find any lesson or task by keyword.

## 2. Management & Editing

- **Bulk Actions**
  - Support selecting multiple lessons or tasks for bulk delete, publish, archive, or move.
- **Inline & Quick Editing**
  - Allow inline editing of lesson/task titles, descriptions, and statuses directly in the list or table.
  - Add quick action buttons (edit, delete, duplicate, preview) visible on hover or always present.
- **Drag-and-Drop**
  - Enable drag-and-drop reordering of modules, lessons within modules, and tasks within lessons.
- **Resource Attachment**
  - Allow attaching files, links, or videos to lessons and tasks. Show attachment icons and previews.
- **Versioning & Undo**
  - Provide version history for lessons/tasks and undo/redo for recent changes.

## 3. Engagement & Feedback

- **Rich Content**
  - Support rich text, images, and embedded media in lesson/task descriptions and instructions.
- **Scheduling & Notifications**
  - Add due dates and scheduling for tasks, with calendar picker and reminders.
  - Notify users of upcoming, overdue, or newly assigned tasks.
- **Empty & Success States**
  - Show friendly illustrations and clear calls to action when no lessons/tasks exist or after successful actions.

  - Display summary stats (total lessons, tasks, completion rate, overdue count) at the top of each section.
  - Integrate progress bars and completion indicators for lessons and tasks.
