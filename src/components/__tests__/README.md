# Component Tests

This folder contains unit and integration tests for React components using React Testing Library and Jest.

## How to Run Tests

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom
   ```
2. Run all tests:
   ```
   npm test
   ```

- Place test files alongside components in a `__tests__` folder.
- Test files should be named `ComponentName.test.jsx` or `ComponentName.test.js`.
