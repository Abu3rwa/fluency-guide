# Student Learning Flow Plan

This document outlines the plan for the student journey, from signing up to starting their learning.

## 1. Student Signup/Registration

**Goal:** A new user creates an account on the platform.

**Flow:**

1.  **Landing Page:** The user lands on the main page which has a clear "Sign Up" or "Get Started" button.
2.  **Signup Form:** Clicking the button takes the user to a registration form with the following fields:
    - Full Name
    - Email Address
    - Password
    - Confirm Password
3.  **Validation:**
    - Client-side validation for all fields (e.g., required, valid email format, password strength).
    - Server-side validation to check if the email is already registered.
4.  **Account Creation:** Upon successful submission, a new student account is created in the database. The password should be securely hashed.
5.  **Email Verification (Optional but Recommended):**
    - An email is sent to the user with a verification link.
    - The user must click the link to activate their account. This step ensures the email is valid.
6.  **Redirection:** After successful signup (and verification, if implemented), the user is automatically logged in and redirected to the main dashboard or a "Welcome" page.

## 2. Course Discovery and Browsing

**Goal:** The student can find and explore available courses.

**Flow:**

1.  **Courses Page:** A dedicated "Courses" or "All Courses" page that lists all available courses.
2.  **Course Cards:** Each course is displayed as a card with key information:
    - Course Title
    - Brief Description
    - Course Thumbnail/Image
    - Instructor Name (if applicable)
    - Price (or "Free")
3.  **Search and Filter:**
    - A search bar to find courses by title or keywords.
    - Filtering options (e.g., by category, difficulty level, language).
4.  **Course Details Page:** Clicking on a course card navigates the student to the course details page, which includes:
    - Full course description.
    - Syllabus/Curriculum (list of modules and lessons).
    - Information about the instructor.
    - Student reviews and ratings.
    - A clear "Enroll Now" or "Buy Now" button.

## 3. Course Enrollment

**Goal:** The student enrolls in a course.

**Flow:**

1.  **Initiate Enrollment:** The student clicks the "Enroll Now" button on the course details page.
2.  **Payment (if applicable):**
    - If the course is paid, the user is redirected to a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
    - The user enters their payment details.
    - Upon successful payment, the enrollment is confirmed.
3.  **Free Enrollment:**
    - If the course is free, clicking "Enroll Now" directly confirms the enrollment.
4.  **Confirmation:**
    - The system records the enrollment, linking the student's account to the course.
    - The student sees a confirmation message.
    - The student might be redirected to their dashboard or the course's main page.
    - The "Enroll Now" button on the course details page changes to "Go to Course" or "Start Learning".

## 4. Start Learning

**Goal:** The student begins to interact with the course content.

**Flow:**

1.  **Student Dashboard:** The student's dashboard should have a "My Courses" section listing all enrolled courses.
2.  **Accessing a Course:** The student clicks on a course from their dashboard.
3.  **Course Player/Lesson View:**
    - The student is taken to the main view for the course.
    - This view typically shows the list of lessons (sidebar) and the content of the currently selected lesson (main area).
    - The system should track the student's progress, so it can resume from the last viewed lesson.
4.  **Navigating Lessons:**
    - The student can click on any lesson in the list to view its content (video, text, quiz, etc.).
    - "Next" and "Previous" buttons allow for sequential navigation through lessons.
5.  **Tracking Progress:**
    - As the student completes lessons (e.g., watches a video, passes a quiz), the system marks the lesson as complete.
    - A progress bar for the entire course is updated to reflect the completion status.
