## 5. Step-by-Step Improvement Prompt

Use this checklist to systematically improve the Course Management Dashboard. Tackle each step in order, or prioritize based on user needs and business value.

### 1. Foundation & Usability (Expanded)

#### 1.1. UI Consistency & Clarity

- [ ] Audit all screens for consistent use of colors, typography, spacing, and button styles.
- [ ] Standardize layout grids and responsive breakpoints.
- [ ] Use a shared component library (e.g., Material-UI) for all UI elements.
- [ ] Ensure all icons and labels are clear and intuitive.
- [ ] Remove unused or redundant UI components and CSS.

#### 1.2. Form Validation & Error Handling

- [ ] Add client-side validation to all forms (required fields, correct formats, min/max values).
- [ ] Display clear, actionable error messages near the relevant fields.
- [ ] Show success messages or feedback after form submission.
- [ ] Prevent duplicate submissions and show loading indicators during async actions.
- [ ] Handle API/server errors gracefully and inform the user.

#### 1.3. Tooltips & Contextual Help

- [ ] Add tooltips to all icons, buttons, and actions that may not be self-explanatory.
- [ ] Provide inline help text or info icons for complex form fields.
- [ ] Link to documentation or FAQs where appropriate.

#### 1.4. Accessibility (a11y)

- [ ] Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and usable via keyboard (Tab, Enter, Space, etc.).
- [ ] Add ARIA labels, roles, and attributes to all custom components.
- [ ] Use semantic HTML (headings, lists, buttons, etc.) for structure.
- [ ] Test with a screen reader (NVDA, VoiceOver, etc.) and fix any issues.
- [ ] Ensure sufficient color contrast and support for dark mode.

#### 1.5. Internationalization (i18n)

- [ ] Audit all UI and error messages for hardcoded strings; replace with translation keys.
- [ ] Ensure all supported languages are up-to-date and complete.
- [ ] Add language switcher and test switching between locales.
- [ ] Document the process for adding new translation keys and languages.
