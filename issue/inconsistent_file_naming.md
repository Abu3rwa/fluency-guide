## Inconsistent File Naming

There are inconsistencies in file naming conventions. For example, there is a `firebase.js` in `src/` and `src/config/`. This can lead to confusion and make it harder to maintain the codebase.

**Recommendation:** Consolidate configuration files into the `src/config` directory and ensure a consistent naming scheme for all files.
