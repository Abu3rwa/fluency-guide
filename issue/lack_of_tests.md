## Lack of Tests

The `src/components/__tests__` directory contains only a few test files. For a project of this size, the test coverage is very low. This increases the risk of bugs and makes it harder to refactor with confidence.

**Recommendation:** Increase test coverage by writing unit and integration tests for all major components and services.
